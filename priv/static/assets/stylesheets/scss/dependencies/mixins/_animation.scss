// Compass CSS3 mixins donâ€™t yet handle vendor prefixes for CSS animations,
// so this is a very simple mixin to simulate that functionality.

@mixin animation($name, $duration: 1000ms, $iterations: infinite, $timing-function: ease, $delay: 0ms) {
  // There is a FF bug that requires all time values to have units, even 0 !!!!!!
  -webkit-animation: $name $duration $iterations $timing-function $delay;
  -moz-animation: $name $duration $iterations $timing-function $delay;
  -o-animation: $name $duration $iterations $timing-function $delay;
  animation: $name $duration $iterations $timing-function $delay;
